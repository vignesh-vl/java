public class unicode {
    // universal  internation standard encoding  that is capable of representing mmost of the worlds written languages 

    /* PROBLEMS :

     A particular code value corresponds to different letters in the various language standards.
     The encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length.Some common characters are encoded as single bytes, other require two or more byte
     
     */

    /* SOLUTION :  

    To solve these problems, a new language standard was developed i.e. Unicode System.
    In unicode, character holds 2 byte, so java also uses 2 byte for characters.
    lowest value:\u0000
    highest value:\uFFFF
